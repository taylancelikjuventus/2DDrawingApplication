This is a simple drawing application providing most basic features mentioned below.

1.How to Draw :
  Arbitrary Shapes/Line : mouse down + drag + mouse up
  Curve : select first control point by clicking on canvas
          select second point by clicking on canvas
          select start point by clicking on canvas
          select end point by clicking on canvas
  Polygon: click + drag mouse + click to draw first line.
           To end drawing just double click on canvas.
  
  Rectangle/Circle/Pentagon etc ... : select one of those from combobox and 
  click on canvas and drag mouse.You will see a rectangular area starts appearing.  
  Mouse up event will fill inside the rectangular area with the shape selected from combobox.
  If you want to draw filled shapes check the checkbox next to label named "Filled Shape".
  Then do the same to draw filled shapes.

2.Edit Mode: Press Edit button on Control panel this opens up a rectangular area 
             Drag this rectangleover the area on which you want to do some transformation.
             t button : press and old this button and drag your mouse to translate pixels under
                        rectanglular area
             r button : click this to rotate shape under rectanglular area
             su button : scales up the shape under rectanglular area
             sd button : scales down the shape under rectangular area
             c button : clears area
             x button : press tihs to close edit mode.

3.Saving Your Drawing as Image File : Just press Save button and your browser will open up 
  Save Dialog.File format was set to "png".

  Note: Canvas's background color will not be same in the image you saved.This is because
        default color of image background is white or gray.If you want red or green backgrounds
        just paint the canvas with that color.You can draw a filled rectangle with the same size of
        Canvas.

4.Opening other Image Files : Click Browse button and select the Image file you want to open.

5.You can resize canvas with buttons at the border of canvas.

Note : Project is tested on Mozilla Firefox and all the events are implemented manually .
       In browser's web console you will see  errors like function name is undefined.
       This is because I added those event handlers to caller objects in order to fire events
       on first click/mousedown etc... otherwise most of the events are not fired at the
       correct time.After all, it works fine!
